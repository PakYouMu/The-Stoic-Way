## Introduction
The Stoic Way is a software application aimed at promoting and facilitating the practice of Stoicism; an ancient school of thought that focuses on reason, self-control, and the acceptance of fate. In today's world, the lack of a daily reminder to be in control of our thoughts, reasoning, and situations has become a significant problem, as it has been replaced with self-centered pleasure-seeking. The Stoic Way aims to address this issue by providing a tool for individuals to incorporate Stoic principles into their daily lives. The Stoic Way is a quote of the day applicaton that also doubles as a Pomodoro Timer application for productivitiy!
